## UX & Design

### Website Objectives

### User Stories

### Typography

### Colour Scheme

### Wireframes
[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was the app used to create the wireframes. As the game is heavily based on JavaAcript changing the DOM, these are basic layouts which get more complex due to the code behind them.

As it is a game with a fixed viewing are for screen size tablet and above, the desktop/tablet layout are the exact same, so they will be grouped together in the table below.

Page | Desktop/Tablet Version | Mobile Version
--- | --- | ---
Intro Page | ![Desktop intro page wireframe image](docs/wireframes/intro-page-desk-tab.png) | ![Mobile intro page wireframe image](docs/wireframes/intro-page-mobile.png)
Front Page | ![Desktop front page wireframe image](docs/wireframes/front-page-desk-tab.png) | ![Mobile front page wireframe image](docs/wireframes/front-page-mobile.png)
